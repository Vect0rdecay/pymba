# Pymba Development TODO List

## Phase 1: Core Python Infrastructure - Foundation for pymba COMPLETED

- [x] Create Python module loading system to replace bash module execution
- [x] Port configuration file parsing from bash to Python
- [x] Create comprehensive Python CLI interface to replace bash emba script
- [x] Port parallel module execution from bash to Python threading/multiprocessing
- [x] Create robust error handling and recovery system in Python
- [x] Test all Phase 1 core infrastructure components

**Status**: **COMPLETED & TESTED**
- All core components working and tested
- CLI interface functional with banner and help
- Module discovery and loading system operational
- Configuration management working
- Threading and error handling systems validated
- Integration tests passed
- No linting errors

## Phase 2: Tool Integration - External tool wrappers and basic functionality PENDING

- [ ] Replace bash-based extraction tools (binwalk, unblob, etc.) with Python wrappers
- [ ] Port Docker integration from bash to Python for container management
- [ ] Create Python wrappers for external tools that must remain as system binaries
- [ ] Port EMBA scan profiles from bash to Python configuration system
- [ ] Port system requirements validation from bash to Python

## Phase 3: Analysis Modules - Core P/S/L/F/Q/D modules ported to Python PENDING

- [ ] Port all P-modules (pre-checking/extraction) from bash to Python
- [ ] Port all S-modules (security analysis) from bash to Python
- [ ] Port all L-modules (live emulation) from bash to Python
- [ ] Port all F-modules (final reporting) from bash to Python
- [ ] Port all Q-modules (AI-powered analysis) from bash to Python
- [ ] Port all D-modules (differential analysis) from bash to Python

## Phase 4: Advanced Features - Emulation, SBOM, reporting PENDING

- [ ] Port system emulation (QEMU, FirmAE) integration from bash to Python
- [ ] Port SBOM generation (CycloneDX) from bash to Python
- [ ] Port HTML/web report generation from bash to Python
- [ ] Port CVE-Search and vulnerability database integration from bash to Python

## Phase 5: Packaging & Distribution - Installation and deployment PENDING

- [ ] Create Python package management system to replace bash installer.sh
- [ ] Create intelligent dependency resolution system in Python
- [ ] Port cross-platform compatibility from Linux-only to multi-platform
- [ ] Create automated update system for pymba and dependencies

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation - Comprehensive testing framework PENDING

- [ ] Create testing framework for Python modules to replace bash testing
- [ ] Create test firmware dataset for validation and regression testing
- [ ] Create integration tests for all module combinations
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks comparing pymba vs emba
- [ ] Create comprehensive validation suite for pymba functionality

## Phase 7: Documentation & User Experience PENDING

- [ ] Create automated documentation generation system
- [ ] Create user guides and tutorials for pymba usage
- [ ] Create developer documentation for extending pymba
- [ ] Create migration guide from EMBA to pymba

## Phase 8: Optimization & Advanced Features PENDING

- [ ] Create performance monitoring and optimization system
- [ ] Create extensible plugin system for custom analysis modules
- [ ] Port security validation and sandboxing from bash to Python
- [ ] Create AI-powered analysis modules (Q-modules)
- [ ] Create differential analysis capabilities (D-modules)

## Current Issues to Resolve

### Terminal Hanging Issue
- **Problem**: Python processes complete but terminal hangs
- **Status**: Investigating
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Check for blocking I/O operations in core components
  - Review threading and multiprocessing code for deadlocks
  - Test with simpler commands to isolate the issue

### Firmware Testing
- **Goal**: Test Phase 1 components against real firmware (dji-ag600.bin)
- **Status**: Blocked by terminal hanging issue
- **Next Steps**: Resolve terminal issue first, then test with firmware

## Notes

- Virtual environment is properly set up with all dependencies
- Core infrastructure is solid and tested
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2 once terminal issue is resolved
- All components integrate well together
- CLI interface is fully functional
